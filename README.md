# Sprites

The Sprites project is composed of Java FX and Android applications: 

* a movie player: a movie is composed of successive sequences; a sequence is composed of a background and several overlapped mobile sprites. The movie is described using a JSON format. 

* a platform game: a game is composed of levels; a level is composed of a background and several sprites of different types. The player is represented by a mobile sprite. The game is described using a JSON format.

This version is a preliminary version that provides only classes and interfaces to load/save Zip files that contain JSON objects descriptions and other resource files (text files)
